-   [CompressJPEG](https://compressjpeg.com/) The big images bigger than 5M needed to be compressed to improve the website's loading time.

# Testing 
## Code validation 
I used [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) and [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to check the validity of the website code.

No issues were identified on **W3C Markup Validation**.

## Color Contrast 
The initial `color: ##81b214;` had Contrast Ratio of 2.52:1 with the white background. So I changed it to a darker green. The [Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://webaim.org/) was used to test for colour contrast on the project.
